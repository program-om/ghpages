This doc is reporting the progress of publishing my website on github pages. I run into an error which did not fix yet.

the app should run on this url:
https://program-om.github.io/ghpages

I am following the instructions on this youtube vid

The main error:
angular-cli-ghpages index.html could not be copied to 404.html. Continuing without an error.
